For PhD Akra University (Student) Assignment , learning the basics of github 
Shows step by step to sign up and upload files 
This tutorial will show you how to upload a group of files to a GitHub repository.
Uploading your files to a GitHub repository lets you:
Apply version control when you make edits to the files, so your project's history is protected and manageable.
Back up your work, because your files are now stored in the cloud.
Pin the repository to your personal profile, so that others can see your work.
Share and discuss your work with others, either publicly or privately.
